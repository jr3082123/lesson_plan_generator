#Synopsis:
The need for personalized instruction has become very important. The diversity in todayâ€™s classrooms presents educators with new challenges related to learning styles and the increased presence of students with disabilities. These challenges have highlighted the need for new and innovative ways to support students and educators where traditional lesson planning methods often have proved inadequate. The goal of this project is to develop a lesson plan generator that leverages user input through an intuitive interface to produce personalized lesson plans. By automating and simplifying the process of lesson plan creation, this tool will allow educators to individualize educational experiences more efficiently.
